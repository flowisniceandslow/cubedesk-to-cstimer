Convert CubeDesk data to csTimer data

https://convert.elder.quest/
================================

This data conversion is not exactly 1:1, however, it should be enough if you're just looking to transfer times and sessions.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This script was put together very quickly and the possibility of data loss is not zero. I take no responsility for any data loss. Backups, backups, backups.

WARNING! THIS WILL OVERWRITE ANY SOLVES YOU CURRENTLY HAVE IN CSTIMER!
