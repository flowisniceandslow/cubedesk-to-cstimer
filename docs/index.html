    <h1>Convert CubeDesk data to csTimer data</h1>
    <h2>This data conversion is not exactly 1:1, however, it should be enough if you're just looking to transfer times
        and
        sessions.</h2>
    <h2>This script was put together very quickly and the possibility of data loss is not zero. I take no responsility
        for any data loss. Backups, backups, backups.</h2>
    <h2 style="color: red;">WARNING! THIS WILL OVERWRITE ANY SOLVES YOU CURRENTLY HAVE IN CSTIMER!</h2>

    <p>Select your CubeDesk export file (this does not upload your results to the website):</p>
